    \Large\textbf{Real Time Computing}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item System that reacts to exteriors events. Events are
        asynchronous regarding the activites carried out by the computer.
    \item Every events must be treated, real time systems or reactive systems.
    \item The system must react in a specified delay.
    \item Determinism is compulsory, each operation must be done in a defined
        amount of time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fundamentals}
\subsection{Real Time System}
\begin{defn}
    A real time system is a system which reacts in a foreseeable time to each
    external stimuli which reaches it.

    Processing time must not depend on the input data.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    Use of buffers endangers determinism, for instance, computing time won't be
    the same if data has been buffered.
\end{rem}

\subsection{RTS taxonomy}
Three types of rts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hard real-time: critical system, every deadline must be treated, in 
        the given amount of time.
    \item Soft real-time: some deadlines can be missed.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Lifetime of data}
Data must be processed quickly enough, as they might be transient (e.g.\ gnss
location while moving). To manage data, they are timestamped. This timestamp is
examined before processing data to verify whether the data is relevant.

\subsection{Time factor}
Application based real time systems 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delivery time: max amount of time allowed to carry out the associated
        processing to an event.
    \item Urgency: Require to impose a priority hierarchy taking into account
        simultaneous event requests while insuring that each event could be
        dealt with within its own time limit (delivery time). Enables conceptor
        to set priorities to tasks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dealing with the Timing Constraints}
\begin{description}
    \item [Low timing constraint]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Process evolving relatively slowly (compared to the system).
            \item Use of a sampling loop, in which  each sensor is queried.
            \item Looping frequency must be controlled (worst case).
        \end{itemize}
    \item[Low timing constraint overall and  constraining events]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use of interruption mechanism.
            \item Still using a main sampling loop, interrupted by interrupt
                requests.
        \end{itemize}
\end{description}
